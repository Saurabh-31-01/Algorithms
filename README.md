# Algorithms

1) Union-find which i used in dynamic connectiviy :- best algo for it is Weighted quick union path compression 
                                                  O(N + M lg * N) { M union - find operations on a set of N objects}
Applications :- 
  Percolation.
・Games (Go, Hex).
✓ Dynamic connectivity.
・Least common ancestor.
・Equivalence of finite state automata.
・Hoshen-Kopelman algorithm in physics.
・Hinley-Milner polymorphic type inference.
・Kruskal's minimum spanning tree algorithm.
・Compiling equivalence statements in Fortran.
・Morphological attribute openings and closings.
・Matlab's bwlabel() function in image processing

2) Search in Bitonic Array - O(lg N)

3) Optimized Three sum - O(n ^ 2)
